42Y27=Parameters are not allowed in the trigger action.
43X18.U=Indexes updated
XBCXW.S=The message digest algorithm ''{0}'' is not supported by any of the available cryptography providers. Please install a cryptography provider that supports that algorithm, or specify another algorithm in the derby.authentication.builtin.algorithm property.
43X36.U=scan qualifiers
43X54.U=Hash keys are column numbers
42Z35.U=next time (milliseconds) \=
42X28=Delete table ''{0}'' is not target of cursor ''{1}''.
43X72.U=at {0} isolation level using {1} locking chosen by the optimizer
42X55=Table name ''{1}'' should be the same as ''{0}''.
42Z17=Invalid length specified for column ''{0}''. Length must be greater than the current column length.
43X90.U=Nested Loop Left Outer Join ResultSet
42X82=The USING clause returned more than one row. Only single-row ResultSets are permissible.
42Z71=XML values are not allowed in top-level result sets; try using XMLSERIALIZE.
43Y08.U=Sort
42Y45=VTI ''{0}'' cannot be bound because it is a special trigger VTI and this statement is not part of a trigger action or WHEN clause.
22020=Invalid trim string, ''{0}''. The trim string must be exactly one character or NULL. It cannot be more than one character.
43Y26.U=Optimize Time
XSLAT.D=The log directory ''{0}'' exists. The directory might belong to another database. Check that the location specified for the logDevice attribute is correct.

42X19=The WHERE or HAVING clause or CHECK CONSTRAINT definition is a ''{0}'' expression.  It must be a BOOLEAN expression.
43X09.U=seconds
42000=Syntax error or access rule violation; see additional errors for details.
42X46=There are multiple functions named ''{0}''. Use the full signature or the specific name.
42X73=Method resolution for signature {0}.{1}({2}) was ambiguous. (No single maximally specific method.)
42Z08=Bulk insert replace is not permitted on ''{0}'' because it has an enabled trigger ({1}).

42Z44.U=Ordered nulls
43X63.U=Index Row to Base Row
42Y36=Column reference ''{0}'' is invalid, or is part of an invalid expression.  For a SELECT list with a GROUP BY, the columns and expressions being selected may only contain valid grouping expressions and valid aggregate expressions.
43X81.U=Rows returned
22011=The second or third argument of the SUBSTR function is out of range.
42Y63=Hash join requires an optimizable equijoin predicate on a column in the selected index or heap.  An optimizable equijoin predicate does not exist on any column in table or index ''{0}''. Use the ''index'' optimizer override to specify such an index or the heap on table ''{1}''.
42Z80.U=serializable
42Y90=FOR UPDATE is not permitted in this type of statement.  
42X37=The unary ''{0}'' operator is not allowed on the ''{1}'' type.
