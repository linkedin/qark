		UseCheckPermission
	------------------
	Summary: Using the result of check permission calls

	Priority: 6 / 10
	Severity: Warning
	Category: Security

	You normally want to use the result of checking a permission; these methods
	return whether the permission is held; they do not throw an error if the
	permission is not granted. Code which does not do anything with the return
	value probably meant to be calling the enforce methods instead, e.g. rather
	than Context#checkCallingPermission it should call
	Context#enforceCallingPermission.
