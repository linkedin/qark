For PyPubSub v3.3.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* cleanup low-level API: exception classes, moved some out of pub module that did not 
  belong there (clutter), move couple modules, 
* completed the reference documentation
* support installation via pip
* follow some guidelines in some PEPs such as PEP 396 and PEP 8
* support Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2 to 3.4a4 but drop support for Python <= 2.5

For PyPubSub v3.2.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a minor release for small improvements made (see docs/CHANGELOG.txt) 
based on feedback from user community. In particular an XML reader for 
topic specification contributed by Josh English. Also cleaned up the 
documentation, updated the examples folder (available in source distribution
as well as `online`_). 

.. _online: https://sourceforge.net/p/pubsub/code/HEAD/tree/

Only 3 changes to API (function names): 

* renamed pub.getDefaultRootAllTopics to pub.getDefaultTopicTreeRoot
* removed pub.importTopicTree: use pub.addTopicDefnProvider(source, format)
* renamed pub.exportTopicTree to pub.exportTopicTreeSpec

For PyPubSub v3.1.0b1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Major cleanup of the API since 3.0 and better support 
for the legacy wxPython code. Defining a topic tree 
via a text file has been improved drastically, making it
simpler to document topic messages and payload data
required or optional. More examples have been added, 
and the messaging protocols clarified. 

The included docs are not yet updated, that's what I'm 
working on now and will lead to the 3.1.1b1 release. 
I'm also working on an add-on module that would allow 
two applications to communicate over the network using 
pubsub-type messaging (with topics, etc). The design 
is almost complete.
