#
# This file is used by our JDBC driver to determine values for methods
# from java.sql.DatabaseMetadata whose names match the property keys here.
#
# JDBC driver will take the value and perform
# a statement.execute() request on it, returning the result set or using the
# result set to produce an answer of the required type and format for the
# DatabaseMetadata method.  If the query has AS clauses in its select list items,
# you can be pretty sure that the JDBC driver was looking for a result set,
# because it specifies what it wants the column names to be.
#
# ** NOTE ** At build time, this file is treated as INPUT into an ODBC
# query generation process that reads these queries and, where required,
# performs alterations on them to create ODBC-compliant versions.  The
# output of that query generation process is a file containing 1) all of
# the queries in this file, PLUS 2) an additional set of ODBC-compliant
# queries based on the queries here.  That automatically-generated file
# is the one that makes it into the CLASSES directory, and the one from
# which the Derby engine will load and process metadata queries.  That
# said, please realize that changes you make here could affect the ODBC
# metadata, as well--so in the even that you make any changes here, you
# should make SURE you run all of the metadata tests (JDBC and ODBC alike)
# to verify that the results are correct for BOTH types of clients.
#
# Note that property values can span multiple lines, by ending the line with a \
#
# Note: be sure to always enter SQL keywords in CAPS, this is both
# for convention, and because of the way the parser uppercases
# things (so it is purportedly faster that way).
# And also because it is the only way it will all work in Turkey where
# the turkish locale uppercases i to an upper case dotted i. ( bug 5362)
#
# REMIND: using SYSALIASES; need to deal with ProcedureColumns still.
# there are no procedures or metadata about them in our system yet.
#
# PROCEDURE_TYPE is always procedureResultUnknown for method aliases as it could map to
# multiple methods, some of which could return a value and some not.
#
# 'REMARKS' column is VARCHAR(32672), which is the max length allowed
# for a VARCHAR.  This is because Java methods with the complete
# package name plus possible signature can grow to be rather long.
